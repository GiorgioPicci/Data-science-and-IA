<br><br>

# ðŸ“š About the project:

1 - the idea of the project is to get the database, generate the graph using python tools, analyze the data and handle errors.
2 - then generate artificial intelligences with 2 different learning methods ( in this case Linear Regression and RandomForest)
3 - after that prepare the database for testing and training and choose the one that works best in the project.
